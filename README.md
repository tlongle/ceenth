A basic synthesizer made using C# & WPF for a final school project for the Programming II class.

The focus of this project is to apply basic knowledge of the MVVM (Model-View-Viewmodel) architecture, also applying basic CRUD (Create, Remove, Update, Delete) operations.

The polyphonic audio engine was made using the Naudio library, making it possible to do basic effects, filters, and things of the sort.
